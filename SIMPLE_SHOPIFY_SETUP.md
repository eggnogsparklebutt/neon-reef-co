# Simple Shopify Setup for Neon Reef Co

## üö® Important: Your website CANNOT connect directly to Shopify!

Your beautiful website is built with HTML/CSS/JS, but Shopify needs a completely different format. Here are your **3 easiest options**:

---

## Option 1: Two Separate Sites (EASIEST - Do This First!) ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Deploy Your Website
1. Upload your files to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages
3. Your site will be at: `https://eggnogsparklebutt.github.io/neon-reef-co/`

### Step 2: Create Shopify Store
1. Go to shopify.com and create your store
2. Pick any free theme (Dawn is good)
3. Add your products

### Step 3: Connect Them
Add this button to your website's index.html:
```html
<a href="https://your-store.myshopify.com" class="btn btn-primary">
  Visit Our Store
</a>
```

**That's it! Your website showcases, Shopify handles sales.**

## Option 2: Add Shopify Buy Buttons üõí

1. Go to **Sales Channels** ‚Üí **Buy Button**
2. Click **Create Buy Button**
3. Select a product
4. Customize the button style
5. Click **Generate Code**

### Step 2: Copy the Code
You'll get something like this:
```html
<div id='product-component-1701234567890'></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
/*<![CDATA[*/
(function () {
  // ... Shopify will give you this code ...
})();
/*]]>*/
</script>
```

### Step 3: Paste in Your Website
In your index.html, replace any "Add to Cart" button with the Shopify code.

## Option 3: Use a Page Builder (If You Want Everything in Shopify) üé®

### Step 1: Install an App
In Shopify Admin ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Search for:
- **PageFly** (free plan available)

## ‚ùì Still Confused?

**The Truth**: Your HTML website and Shopify speak different languages. Instead of translating (which is hard), just use them separately and link them together.

Think of it like:
- Your website = Beautiful showroom
- Shopify = Cash register

They don't need to be the same thing!
